* Build system rewritten (NOTICE: configure options was modified). 
* None privileged configuration added, as a result /etc/openct.conf ifdhandler
  was modified, please review sample at etc/openct.conf before upgrade.
* The usb device add (/dev/bus/usb/$env{BUSNUM}/$env{DEVNUM}) udev rule is now
  available in separate file, as it should be available at most distributions,
  and may conflict. Install this only if you are using old udev that miss this
  statement.
* Basic coldplug support on Linux is available without libusb dependency.
* CCID-1.10 is now supported.

* this version works with linux kernel 2.6.22+ if patched, see
  http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/17/193 for a patch.
  will be fixed in 2.6.22.6 I hope.
* improve etc/openct_usb.in script for working without PRODUCT environment

New in 0.6.12; 2007-07-11; Andreas Jellinghaus
* add alternative udev rules based on MODALIAS.
* update wiki export (fix links, add images).
* remove TEST_MINUS_S_SH tests from configure (not needed).

* rename variables clashing with function names such as index.
* fix DragonFly BSD build.
* add small delays to smph driver, suggested by  Alexej Wassiljew.
* fix pcsclite compile issue (Ludovic Rousseau).
* add ccid as fallback driver if no other is found (linux only, FIXME others).
* add more drivers to etc/ files, get them in sync.
* fix lots of warnings/issues found by sparse.
* add patch by harald welte for contactless reader support (librfid).
* add set_params to pcmcia and pcmcia-block code to
  get cm4000/cm4040 drivers to work again.

New in 0.6.11; 2006-11-22; Andreas Jellinghaus
* add usb reset for non-linux too (dummy code only).
* fix three small bugs/warnings

New in 0.6.10; 2006-11-11; Andreas Jellinghaus
* fix etc/Makefile installation (Ville Skytta)
* bsd compile fixed (Markus Schatzl)
* include string.h in utils.c (Dann Frazier)
* fix 'BUS="pcmcia"' match in udev rules file.
* improve egate reset logic (Chaskiel Grundman, bugs by AJ)
* implement usb reset (Andrey Jivsov)

New in 0.6.9; 2006-09-20; Andreas Jellinghaus
* more work on wbeiuu driver.
* better handling of usb devices for openbsd.
* small delays in egate initialisation for new sealed egate token.
* small bugfix in socket code.
* fix openct.conf for wbeeui driver.
* move scripts used by udev to /lib/udev/ by default.
* udev scripts for usb, pcmcia_block and serial readers.
* add several usb ids to ccid driver config.
* small fix in ccid driver with configuration 0.
* don't claim interface in device_open, instead make sure all drivers
  call ifd_device_set_parameters which will (in the case of usb) claim
  the interface.
* cleanup the parameters to ifdhandler and openct-control attach.
  include type of the device in these parameters. do not drop the
  type if already known. this change requires the updated hotplug files.

New in 0.6.8; 2006-06-19; Andreas Jellinghaus
Fix bug in socket code: retry if read() returns -1/EINTR.

New in 0.6.7; 2006-05-01; Andreas Jellinghaus
* configure.ac uses now pkg-config.
* sys-linux.c does not need kernel headers (all data etc. included)
* now generating a Changelog file in the documentation
* all urls now based on http://www.opensc-project.org/
* wiki documentation included as html snapshot
* new driver for WB Electronics' Infinity USB Unlimited by Juan Carlos Borras
* bug in sleep code fixed.
* new pertosmart ac1038 driver by Carlos Henrique Bauer
* new smartkey driver: not finished yet
* support for both /proc/bus/usb and /dev/bus/usb devices with linux
* improved T=1 implementation by Ludovic Rousseau
* improved eutron driver by Chaskiel Grundman
* OPENCT_SOCKETDIR environment can point to any dir for the sockets so
  users can use it without being root.
* samle confi files for both hald and udev.
  we suggest udev as hotplug replacement. hald is not tested.
* sample reader.conf included for pcsc-lite.
  remember to use opensc->openct or opensc->pcsc->openct but not both.
* add phoenix/smartmouse driver by Antoine Nguyen
  based on sctk by Alexandre Becoulet
* License is now officialy LGPL. So far it was BSD/LGPL
  dual licensed, and most parts still are, but we already
  had some usb code under LGPL and now got another driver
  under LGPL, so the project as whole is considered LGPL.
  Libopenct is still 100% BSD, in case you want to use it.
  so this only affects the ifdhandler process and other tools.
* Siemens B1 driver improved by Lorenz Knauer.
