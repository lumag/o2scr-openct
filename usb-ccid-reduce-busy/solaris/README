Creating an installable package for Solaris Sunray (SRSS 3.1)
=============================================================

The files in this directory are an attempt to ease
the building of openct packages for Solaris running
as Sunray Server.

The basic steps to create Solaris packages are:
# make -f Makefile.server build
# make -f Makefile.server dist
# make -f Makefile.server package
# make -f Makefile.client build
# make -f Makefile.client dist
# make -f Makefile.client package

NOTE: If using the GNU compiler adjust the Makefile

TODO:

Start/stop utopenct service for active Sunrays.
