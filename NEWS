NEWS for OpenCT -- History of user visible changes

New in 0.6.10; 2006-??-??; Andreas Jellinghaus
* fix etc/Makefile installation (Ville Skytta)
* bsd compile fixed (Markus Schatzl)
* include string.h in utils.c (Dann Frazier)
* fix 'BUS="pcmcia"' match in udev rules file.
* improve egate reset logic (Chaskiel Grundman, bugs by AJ)

New in 0.6.9; 2006-09-20; Andreas Jellinghaus
* more work on wbeiuu driver.
* better handling of usb devices for openbsd.
* small delays in egate initialisation for new sealed egate token.
* small bugfix in socket code.
* fix openct.conf for wbeeui driver.
* move scripts used by udev to /lib/udev/ by default.
* udev scripts for usb, pcmcia_block and serial readers.
* add several usb ids to ccid driver config.
* small fix in ccid driver with configuration 0.
* don't claim interface in device_open, instead make sure all drivers
  call ifd_device_set_parameters which will (in the case of usb) claim
  the interface.
* cleanup the parameters to ifdhandler and openct-control attach.
  include type of the device in these parameters. do not drop the
  type if already known. this change requires the updated hotplug files.

New in 0.6.8; 2006-06-19; Andreas Jellinghaus
Fix bug in socket code: retry if read() returns -1/EINTR.

New in 0.6.7; 2006-05-01; Andreas Jellinghaus
* configure.ac uses now pkg-config.
* sys-linux.c does not need kernel headers (all data etc. included)
* now generating a Changelog file in the documentation
* all urls now based on http://www.opensc-project.org/
* wiki documentation included as html snapshot
* new driver for WB Electronics' Infinity USB Unlimited by Juan Carlos Borras
* bug in sleep code fixed.
* new pertosmart ac1038 driver by Carlos Henrique Bauer
* new smartkey driver: not finished yet
* support for both /proc/bus/usb and /dev/bus/usb devices with linux
* improved T=1 implementation by Ludovic Rousseau
* improved eutron driver by Chaskiel Grundman
* OPENCT_SOCKETDIR environment can point to any dir for the sockets so
  users can use it without being root.
* samle confi files for both hald and udev.
  we suggest udev as hotplug replacement. hald is not tested.
* sample reader.conf included for pcsc-lite.
  remember to use opensc->openct or opensc->pcsc->openct but not both.
* add phoenix/smartmouse driver by Antoine Nguyen
  based on sctk by Alexandre Becoulet
* License is now officialy LGPL. So far it was BSD/LGPL
  dual licensed, and most parts still are, but we already
  had some usb code under LGPL and now got another driver
  under LGPL, so the project as whole is considered LGPL.
  Libopenct is still 100% BSD, in case you want to use it.
  so this only affects the ifdhandler process and other tools.
* Siemens B1 driver improved by Lorenz Knauer.
