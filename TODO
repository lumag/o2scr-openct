TODO list

 -	add resource manager master socket (for attach/detach notification)
 -	hotplug attach/detach
 -	error handling: use error codes everywhere, add ct_strerror
 -	driver framework: eject_card
 -	resource manager: request icc, eject icc
 -	resource manager: poll card status every few seconds
 	(put card status info into mmapped file so clients don't
	incur the network round-trip time every time they check
	the status?)
 -	resource manager: reliable mechanism to notify client of
 	card change event
 -	find out why client hangs when resource manager crashes
 -	reader backend for opensc
