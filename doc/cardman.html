<h1>Omnikey Cardman</h1>
<p>
The cardman driver might support OMNIKEY CardMan 2020/6020/6120 devices, but
it is not yet complete, and the original author has stopped working on it.
</p>
<p>
The cm4000 driver supports OMNIKEY CardMan 4000. It is available on OpenCT 0.6.5 once released,
but be aware that it doesn't currently do much more than read the ATR of a card, and you'll still
need the kernel module for this card from OMNIKEY.
</p>
<h2>Test results</h2>
<p>
If you have tested one of these readers, please add a report here.
</p>
<ul>
<li>CardMan 4000 on Fedora Core 4test2 with OpenCT 0.6.5rc1: failure (well, it does read the ATR, see above).
</li>
<li>CardMan 6020 on Fedora Core 3 and 4test2 with OpenCT 0.6.5rc1: failure.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternative</h2>
<p>
Some recent OMNIKEY USB readers should work with the generic <a href="ccid.html" shape="rect">USB CCID</a> driver.
