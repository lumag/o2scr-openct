<p>
The cardman driver might support OMNIKEY CardMan 2020/6020/6120 devices, but
it is not yet complete, and the original author has stopped working on it.
</p>
<p>
The cm4000 driver supports OMNIKEY CardMan 4000. It is available in OpenCT 0.6.5 and later,
but be aware that it doesn't currently do much more than read the ATR of a card, and you'll still
need the kernel module for this card from OMNIKEY.
</p>
<p>
CardMan 4040 support is currently under development.
</p>
<p>
If you have any problems with cm4000, 4040, 3121 or 5121, please contact Harald Welte &lt;laforge@gnumonks.org&gt;.
