		<title>About OpenCT</title>

		<para>
			This is OpenCT, a middleware framework for smart card
			terminals.
		</para>

		<para>
			It all started with a reader driver library - Olaf
			wanted to write a library to provide a framework for
			people writing drivers for smart card readers. The idea
			was to provide all the usualy stuff (T=0, T=1, serial
			vs USB device handling, etc) in a single place, and
			reduce driver writing to interaction with the device
			itself. 
		</para>

		<para>
			Olaf added interface bindings for CTAPI and PCSC, both
			of which are broken at the moment because he ended up
			writing my own resource manager.
		</para>
		

		<para>
			OpenCT is an open source implmentation providing card
			terminal drivers. OpenCT was written by Olaf Kirch
			<email>okir@suse.de</email> with contributions
			from the following people:
		</para>

		<orderedlist>
			<listitem>
				 The checksum code for T=1 (src/ifd/checksum.c)
				 was taken from Matthias Bruestle's excellent
				 SCEZ library.
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				The eGate driver was contributed, and is
				copyright by, Chaskiel Grundman
				<email>cg2v@andrew.cmu.edu</email>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				 The eToken driver is loosely based on code
				 written by Andreas Jellinghaus
				 <email>aj@dungeon.inka.de</email>
				 (the ikey3k and eutron driver, too,
				 and most of the documentation)
			 </listitem>

			 <listitem>
				 Markus Friedl helped with the *BSD port.
			 </listitem>
		</orderedlist>

		<para>
			OpenCT provides CT-API drivers, ifdhandler drivers
			as well as it's own resource manager for direct
			use by applications.

		<title>Requirements</title>

		<para>
			To use OpenCT with smart card readers attached to
			the serial port, you only need a kernel with
			a working serial port, nothing special is required.
		</para>

		<para>
			To use OpenCT with smart card readers attached
			via USB you need a bit more: your kernel needs
			to support USB and your kernel needs to support
			the usb controller you are using. On most computers
			the usb controller is part of the mainboard. If
			your mainboard uses intel chips you need most
			likely the "uhci" usb controller support, for
			other vendors most likely the "ohci" controller support.
		</para>

		<para>
			FIXME: I'd like to link to some USB howto with all
			the details and more help. Is there such a HOWTO?
		</para>

		<para>
			You also need to compile your kernel with support for
			the USB device filesystem and mount the filesystem
			to <filename>/proc/bus/usb</filename>. The kernel
			option is CONFIG_USB_DEVICEFS, please turn it on.
			To mount the filesystem, please edit your
			<filename>/etc/fstab</filename>. For a linux kernel
			2.4.* system, it should have a line
			<screen>
none	/proc/bus/usb	usbdevfs	defaults	0	0
			</screen>
			and for a linux kernel 2.5.* or 2.6.* system, it should have a line:
			<screen>
none	/proc/bus/usb	usbfs		defaults	0	0
			</screen>
		</para>

		<para>
			Run <prompt>mount -a </prompt> after editing the
			file <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> for the changes
			to take effect. You can also reboot. If you are using
			sometimes linux kernels 2.4.* and sometimes
			2.5.*/2.6.*, use the line for kernel 2.4.*. You will
			get a warning, but it will still work.
		</para>

		<para>
			Your kernel also needs to be compiled with hotplugging
			support. The relevant kernel option is CONFIG_HOTPLUG.
			You don't need any of the hardware adaptors.
		</para>
	</chapter>

	<chapter>
		<title>Installation</title>

		<para>
			First create the directory
			<filename>/var/run/openct</filename> and set the
			permissions. Do this with the commands:
			<screen>
$ mkdir /var/run/openct
$ chmod 755 /var/run/openct
			</screen>
		</para>

		<para>
			These default permissions will allow everyone
			on your system to use smart card readers
			available via OpenCT. For details and a more
			restricitive setup, please consult the chapter
			on Security.
		</para>

		<para>
			Second you need to install the OpenCT init.d script,
			and make sure it is executed with "start" on every
			boot and with "stop" on every shutdown. To do this
			symlink the script to
			<filename>/etc/init.d/openct</filename>:
			<screen>
$ ln -s /path/to/openct/etc/init.d/init-script /etc/init.d/openct
			</screen>
		</para>

		<para>
			Now configure your runlevels to start the init
			script everytime the system boots, and to stop
			the init script everytime the system shuts down.
			Use whatever your distribution provides or a
			gui tool like the kde runlevel editor.
		</para>

		<para>
			Debian users can do this with a single command:
			<screen>
$ update-rc.d openct start 90 2 3 4 5 . stop 10 0 1 6 .
			</screen>
		</para>

		<para>
			Call the init script once with "start".
			Or reboot. :-)
			<screen>
$ /etc/init.d/openct start
			</screen>
		</para>

		<para>
			And now the last task: if you want to use
			usb readers or usb crypto tokens, you need
			to configure the hotplug system to call
			openct everytime there is a new smart
			card reader or crypto token.
		</para>

		<section>
			<title>Installation without hotplug utils</title>

		<para>
			This section applies, if your system does
			not have hotplug utils installed. If this command
			suceeds, go to the other section:
			<screen>
$ ls /sbin/hotplug
			</screen>
		</para>

		<para>
			If there is no such file, the installation
			is very easy: 
			<screen>
ln -s /path/to/openct/sbin/hotplug.openct /sbin/hotplug
			</screen>
		</para>

		<para>
			Now attach some usb smart card reader or usb crypto
			token. The kernel will start
			<filename>/sbin/hotplug</filename>, and 
			<prompt>openct-tool list</prompt>
			should list the new reader.
		</para>

	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Installation with hotplut utils</title>

		<para>
			First the general instructions, then the debian
			specific instructions. As usual debian does everything
			a bit different. That doesn't mean it is necessarily
			better or worse.
		</para>

		<para>
			Edit <filename>/etc/hotplug/usb.usermap</filename> and
			add these lines:
			<screen>
openct 0x0003 0x0973 0x0001 0x0000 0x0001 0xff 0x00 0x00 0xff 0x00 0x00 0x0000 0000

			</screen>
		</para>

		<para>
			Create the directory
			<filename>/etc/hotplug/usb</filename> and add a symlink
			"openct" to hotplug.openc. 
			<screen>
mkdir /etc/hotplug/openct
ln -s /path/to/openct/sbin/hotplug.openct /etc/hotplug/usb/openct
			</screen>
		</para>
	</section>

	</chapter>

	<chapter>
		<title>Debugging</title>

		<para>
			Edit <filename>openct.conf</filename>
			and set debug to 4.
		</para>

		<para>
			If the problem is with some usb crypto token
			(e.g. Aladdin eToken PRO), please grep for
			usb_control - these are the lines I need
			to see what is happening (or not working).

				This directory holds status files for openct.
				Create it with: <screen>
mkdir /var/run/openct

				</screen>
			</para>
			
			<para>
				By default everyone can use smartcards via
				openct. You can create a group "openct", assign
				users to that group, and limit access to 
				smartcards via openct like this:
				<screen>
chgrp openct /var/run/openct
chmod 750 /var/run/openct
				</screen>
			</para>
		</section>

		<section>
			<title>sbin/openct-control	OpenCT Manager</title>

			<para>
				Run openct-control once to setup the
				<filename>status</filename> file in
				<filename>/var/run/openct</filename>.
				Without that file OpenCT will not work.

		</para>

		<para>
			If you try to use a usb device, please try this:
			Do you have a <filename>/proc</filename> filesystem?
			This command should work:
			<prompt>ls /proc/sys</prompt>
		</para>

		<para>
			Is your kernel compiled with usb support? Does the

		<title>Security</title>

		<para>
			The default setting is not very secure: all users
			can access your smart card readers. Several processes
			can use the same smart card reader at the same time,
			but they always have to be owned by the same users.
			(FIXME: is it necessary to issue a LOCK command for
			this, or will it always work like this?)
		</para>

		<para>
			You can restrict access to smart card readers using
			OpenCT to one user with these
			commands:
			<screen>
$ chown user /var/run/openct
$ chmod 700 /var/run/openct
			</screen>
		</para>

		<para>
			You can also create a group, add users to that group
			and restrict access to smart card readers using OpenCT
			to that group with these commands:
			<screen>
$ chgrp group /var/run/openct
$ chmod 750 /var/run/openct
			</screen>
		</para>

		<para>
			In both cases root can still access the smart
			card readers. Replace <replaceable>user</replaceable>
			and <replaceable>group</replaceable> with the user
			and group of your choice.
