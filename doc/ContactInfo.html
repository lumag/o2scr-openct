<p>
Please don't contact any of the OpenCT developers directly, unless you have
a good reason. Use one of the mailing lists instead, this is much easier for
both of us. For an in depth explanation read [<a class="ext-link" title="http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/faqs/questions.html" href="http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/faqs/questions.html" shape="rect">http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/faqs/questions.html</a>
this page].
</p>
<h2>Mailing lists</h2>

</li><li>opensc-user - Discussion of end-user questions for OpenSC, OpenCT and SCB

<p>
You need to subscribe to these mailing lists, if you want to post to them.
But you can subscribe and then turn receiving mails off, which might be nice
in case you use gmane or a similar service to read the mailing lists. Outside
postings are not silently dropped, but also not forwarded to the mailing list.
Instead a moderator needs to review every posting and decide, this might add
a delay of several hours or even days.
</p>
<p>
Note you can also send bug reports to bugs@opensc.org in case you don't want to subscribe to
the mailing lists. It might be also good to send security sensitive information to this address.
