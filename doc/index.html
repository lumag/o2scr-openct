<h1>Welcome to OpenCT</h1>
<p>
OpenCT implements drivers for several smart card readers. It comes as driver in
ifdhandler format for PC/SC-Lite, as CT-API driver, or as a small and lean middleware,
so applications can use it with minimal overhead. OpenCT also has a primitive mechanism
to export smart card readers to remote machines via tcp/ip.
</p>
<p>
The basic goal was to implement several drivers without reinventing the wheel with
each new driver. The medium goal was to provide a simple middleware.
</p>
<p>
OpenCT works on linux, solaris and some BSD flavors. Serial drivers should work fine
on any unix including Mac OS X. Usb drivers support for Mac OS X is under development.
Windows is not supported at the moment.
</p>
<p>
OpenCT is licensed under the BSD License in general(see <a href="LicenseText.html" shape="rect">LicenseText</a> and <a href="AuthorsAndCredits.html" shape="rect">AuthorsAndCredits</a>),
but lately some code from libusb have been imported for better usb support, and that code
is licensed under LGPL license. Check each sys-*.c file for details.
</p>
<h2>Readers</h2>
<p>
All recent readers are usb readers and should work with the generic <a href="ccid.html" shape="rect">USB CCID</a> driver.
Here is the full list, most drivers are for readers older than the usb ccid norm or serial readers.
