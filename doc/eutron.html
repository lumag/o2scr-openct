<h1>Eutron CryptoIdendity IT-SEC</h1>
<p>
(Andreas Jellinghaus:) I had one, wrote a driver for it, it worked fine. However somehow I locked it, and can't unlock
it, so I can't test anymore. I guess they still work fine, but even for windows there is not unlock/format tool, as far
as I can see.
</p>
<p>
Not that Eutron has three different <a class="missing" href="/openct/wiki/CryptoIdendity" shape="rect">CryptoIdendity?</a> tokens and the other two were not tested at all and are unsupported.
