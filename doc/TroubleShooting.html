So here are some step by step instructions to find your problem:
</p>
<p>
If you try to use a USB device, please try this: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your /proc filesystem mounted? ls /proc will show some files and directories.
</li>
<li>Is your linux kernel compiled with usb support? Does it work? "lsusb" should list your usb controller and all devices.
</li>
<li>Is your linux kernel compiled with hotplugging support? cat /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug should output "/sbin/hotplug".
</li>
<li>Do you have a hotplug script? ls /sbin/hotplug will list it or print an error message?
</li>
<li>Did you create the directory /var/run/openct? What files are in there? What are the file permissions? ls -la /var/run/openct will tell you.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In all cases:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you install the openct init.d script? Did you run it? 
</li>
<li>Does openct-tool list show your reader?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you are using a usb smart card reader, and openct-tool does not list it: What is that readers USB vendor and product id?
lsusb will tell you. Edit /etc/openct.conf and /etc/hotplug/usb/openct.usermap, check if that entry is listed, and add it if not.
If the reader works after doing this, please contact opensc-devel@opensc.org, so we can add that id to OpenCT.
