<p>
OpenCT needs a config file. It is recommended to configure openct with "--sysconfdir=/etc" so the usual name is /etc/openct.conf.
</p>
<p>
OpenCT needs a directory -- /var/run/openct -- for it's files and sockets.
During bootup OpenCT will create the file -- /var/run/openct/status -- for coordination of all tools.
For each reader there will be a process called "ifdhandler" and a socket in this directory, the name
for the first reader is usualy "0", for the second "1" and so on.
</p>
<p>
OpenCT needs an init.d script to be run at bootup and at shutdown. The script is usualy called /etc/init.d/openct
and there are symlinks in the /etc/rc*.d/ directories pointing to it.
</p>
<p>
On linux systems with hotplugging, OpenCT also has these files:
</p>
<ul><li>/etc/hotplug/usb/openct.usermap -- tells the hotplug system which devices OpenCT knows about.
</li><li>/etc/hotplug/usb/openct -- script called by hotplug for each device added or removed.
</li></ul><p>
OpenCT is shipped with these tools:
</p>
<ul><li>openct-tool -- lists all readers, their names, the atr, waits for a reader or card etc. great for debugging.
</li><li>openct-control -- usualy only called by the init.d script on boot and shutdown
</li><li>ifdhandler -- does all the work in the background, called by openct-control or the hotplug script.
</li></ul><p>
OpenCT is shipped with two plugins/drivers/shared objects:
</p>
<ul><li>libopenctapi.so -- a shared object in CT-API format, you can use this with every ct-api aware application.
</li><li>openct-ifd.so -- a shared obejct in Ifdhandler v2 format, to be used by pcsc-lite as reader.
</li></ul><h2>Shared library</h2>
<p>
If you want to write an application to use openct directly, you can do so using the shared library libopenct.so.
OpenCT also has header files for you in $(prefix)/include/openct/ and it comes with a pkg-config file "libopenct.pc",
see the pkg-config documentation how to use it in your Makefile or autoconf configure.in file. This should make
linking with OpenCT easy, please send us some feedback.
