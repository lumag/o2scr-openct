<h1>Operating Systems</h1>
<h2>Linux</h2>
<p>
Linux should work fine, and is tested all the time.
Serial support needs nothing special (only the serial driver for your
serial device), but usb support on linux has a few requirements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Libusb needed during compilation and runtime.
</li>
<li>CONFIG_HOTPLUG so the kernel can let us know if you plugin a reader or token.
</li>
<li>hotplug utilities will be called by the kernel and run openct.
</li>
<li>CONFIG_USB_DEVICEFS so we can talk to usb devices from userspace.
</li>
<li>mount usbfs (kernel 2.4: usbdevfs) at /proc/bus/usb, to do that put this line into your /etc/fstab:
<pre class="wiki" xml:space="preserve">usbfs           /proc/bus/usb   usbfs   defaults                0       0
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
(replace "usbfs" with "usbdevfs" for linux kernel 2.4.* - will work on kernel 2.6.* too)
</p>
<h2>BSD</h2>
<p>
OpenCT should work, but this wasn't tested for sometime. Latest OpenCT seems to not find libusb,
we are working on it.
</p>
<h2>Solaris</h2>
<p>
Latest OpenCT supports Solaris fine and was tested to work.
</p>
<h2>Sunray</h2>
<p>
Sunray including client/server architecture was recently added to OpenCT and 0.6.5 once release should work fine.
Till then please use a snapshot or svn trunk checkout.
