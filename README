OpenCT, pre-alpha snapshot
==========================

This is OpenCT, a middleware framework for smart card terminals.

It all started with a reader driver library - I wanted to write a
library to provide a framework for people writing drivers for smart
card readers. The idea was to provide all the usualy stuff (T=0, T=1,
serial vs USB device handling, etc) in a single place, and reduce
driver writing to interaction with the device itself.

I added interface bindings for CTAPI (tested) and PCSC (untested),
but ended up writing my own resource manager.

All of this is still work in progress, but I hope to have OpenCT
support in OpenSC very soon.

Currently, the following smart card readers are supported:

etoken		for the Aladdin eToken; tested with Aladdin eToken PRO
kaan		for Kobil readers; tested with Kobil Kaan Professional
towitoko	Towitoko Chipdrives; tested with the Chipdrive micro



Configuring libifd
==================

libifd supports both statically configured readers as well as
USB hotplugging (PCMCIA isn't supported yet, because I don't have
a PCMCIA reader).

To configure libifd, copy the sample ifd.conf file to /etc/ifd.conf
and edit it.

To configure a reader statically (you do this for serial readers),
you need statements like this:

	reader  kaan            /dev/ttyS0;
	reader	towitoko	/dev/ttyS1;

To support USB tokens and the like, simply use "hotplug"
statements that define which driver should be used for a
specific USB device ID.
