Creating an installable package for Solaris 10
==============================================

The files in this directory are an attempt to ease
the building of openct packages for Solaris 10.

The basic steps to create a Solaris 10 package are:
# make build
# make dist
# make package

NOTE: If using the GNU compiler adjust the Makefile

The package contains installs openct as a first class
citizen in /usr, registers openct with SMF and activates
a sysevent driven hotplug handler.
