OpenCT Release 0.1.0
====================

We are pleased to announce the availability OpenCT 0.1.0.

OpenCT is a library for accessing smart card terminals.  It provides a
rich set of functions for driver writers, protocol drivers for T=0 and
T=1, serial and USB functionality, including USB hotplugging.

Currently, the main user of OpenCT is the OpenSC smart card framework,
but OpenCT can of course be used by other applications as well. Shims
that allow OpenCT drivers to be used from pcsc-lite and CT-API applications
are currently under development.

and USB tokens:

 -	Towitoko serial readers
